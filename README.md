Vim-like TODO
=============

Build and manage TODO lists or grocery lists or whatever kind of lists you 
want using Vim-like keyboard shortcuts.

This project is a toy and a kludge and has all kinds of dependencies. Well, 
one dependency. You need to have a MongoDB server running on localhost and you 
need to have the Mongo PECL extension installed and loaded. That's not really 
hard to do.

There is no authentication, little security. You could lose your lists. You 
probably will. Use this project at your own risk, or, better yet, *contribute 
to it!*
